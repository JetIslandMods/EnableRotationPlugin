# EnableRotationPlugin
Don't use this! LOL

#### Warning ####

**May cause motion sickness, dizziness, or loss of balance. Use at your own risk!**

This mod enables a normally inaccessible movement mode, apparently it is left over from the development/beta phase.

But seriously, you better have strong VR legs!

#####Uninstallation#####

To uninstall, which you'll probably want to. Just delete EnableRotationPlugin.dll
